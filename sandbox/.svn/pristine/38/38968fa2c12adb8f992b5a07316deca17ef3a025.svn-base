/** \ingroup thomas
 *  \namespace cutCell Generic implementation of Nitsche's method.
 *   This set of application is mainly used for the demonstrative examples in 
 *   the 'immersed' paper with Fehmi. The specific applications are
 *   - oneDimensional:  Used for the convergence and stability anlysis
 *   - nut: An older, not-published example with a nut composed of two surfaces
 *   - csg: CSG-modelling based on embedding meshes (Laplace and elastic)
 *   - composite: a fibre-reinforced block of material

 *  The acronym stands for Thomas-Peter Fries (Prof. TU Graz), with whom I
 *  tried to understand the beauty of differential geometry. As it turns out
 *  2nd derivatives are not as trivially as initially conceived and moreover
 *  they are in general not symmetric.
