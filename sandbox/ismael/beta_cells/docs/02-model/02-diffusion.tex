We use a continuum model to solve nutrient diffusion, based on the Fick's second law of diffusion. Nutrient consumption is also considered in this model including in the equation \ref{eq:fick} a reaction term, considering a zero order reaction that does not depend on concentration level (\cite{Dunn2006}).   

\begin{equation} \label{eq:fick}
\dfrac{dC}{dt}=\nabla (D\nabla C)-k\cdot U
\end{equation}


It can be observed in equation \eqref{eq:fick} a diffusion term and a reaction term corresponding to the nutrient consumption. On one hand, diffusion term is ruled by concentration (C) and diffusion constant (D). On the other hand, there is a kinetic parameter (k) and a cell density (U) to define consumption term.
