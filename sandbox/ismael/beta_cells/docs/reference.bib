abstract = {The behavior of normal adherent cells is influenced by the stiffness of the substrate they are anchored to. Cells are able to detect substrate mechanical properties by actively generating contractile forces and use this information to migrate and proliferate. In particular, the speed and direction of cell crawling, as well as the rate of cell proliferation, vary with the substrate compliance and prestrain. In this work, we present an active mechanosensing model based on an extension of the classical Hill's model for skeletal muscle behavior. We also propose a thermodynamical approach to model cell migration regulated by mechanical stimuli and a proliferation theory also depending on the mechanical environment. These contributions give rise to a conceptually simple mathematical formulation with a straightforward and inexpensive computational implementation, yielding results consistent with numerous experiments. The model can be a useful tool for practical applications in biology and medicine in situations where cell-substrate interaction as well as substrate mechanical behavior play an important role, such as the design of tissue engineering applications. ?? 2007 Acta Materialia Inc.},

abstract = {The correct development of blood vessels is crucial for all aspects of tissue growth and physiology in vertebrates. The formation of an elaborate hierarchically branched network of endothelial tubes, through either angiogenesis or vasculogenesis, relies on a series of coordinated morphogenic events, but how individual endothelial cells adopt specific phenotypes and how they coordinate their behaviour during vascular patterning is unclear. Recent progress in our understanding of blood vessel formation has been driven by advanced imaging techniques and detailed analyses that have used a combination of powerful in vitro, in vivo and in silico model systems. Here, we summarise these models and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. We then review the different stages of blood vessel development, highlighting the cellular mechanisms and molecular players involved at each step and focusing on cell specification and coordination within the network.},

abstract = {Diffusion coefficients of tracer molecules in collagen type I gels prepared from 0-4.5\% w/v solutions were measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. When adjusted to account for in vivo tortuosity, diffusion coefficients in gels matched previous measurements in four human tumor xenografts with equivalent collagen concentrations. In contrast, hyaluronan solutions hindered diffusion to a lesser extent when prepared at concentrations equivalent to those reported in these tumors. Collagen permeability, determined from flow through gels under hydrostatic pressure, was compared with predictions obtained from application of the Brinkman effective medium model to diffusion data. Permeability predictions matched experimental results at low concentrations, but underestimated measured values at high concentrations. Permeability measurements in gels did not match previous measurements in tumors. Visualization of gels by transmission electron microscopy and light microscopy revealed networks of long collagen fibers at lower concentrations along with shorter fibers at high concentrations. Negligible assembly was detected in collagen solutions pregelation. However, diffusion was similarly hindered in pre and postgelation samples. Comparison of diffusion and convection data in these gels and tumors suggests that collagen may obstruct diffusion more than convection in tumors. These findings have significant implications for drug delivery in tumors and for tissue engineering applications.},

abstract = {Cell migration through 3D tissue depends on a physicochemical balance between cell deformability and physical tissue constraints. Migration rates are further governed by the capacity to degrade ECM by proteolytic enzymes, particularly matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and integrin- and actomyosin-mediated mechanocoupling. Yet, how these parameters cooperate when space is confined remains unclear. Using MMP-degradable collagen lattices or nondegradable substrates of varying porosity, we quantitatively identify the limits of cell migration by physical arrest. MMP-independent migration declined as linear function of pore size and with deformation of the nucleus, with arrest reached at 10\% of the nuclear cross section (tumor cells, 7 µm²; T cells, 4 µm²; neutrophils, 2 µm²). Residual migration under space restriction strongly depended upon MMP-dependent ECM cleavage by enlarging matrix pore diameters, and integrin- and actomyosin-dependent force generation, which jointly propelled the nucleus. The limits of interstitial cell migration thus depend upon scaffold porosity and deformation of the nucleus, with pericellular collagenolysis and mechanocoupling as modulators.},

abstract = {Angiogenesis is crucial during many physiological processes and is influenced by various biochemical and biomechanical factors. Models have proved useful in understanding the mechanisms of angiogenesis and also the characteristics of the capillaries formed as part of the process. We have developed a three-dimensional hybrid, agent-field model where individual cells are modelled as sprout-forming agents in a matrix field. Cell independence, cell-cell communication and stochastic cell response are integral parts of the model. The model simulations incorporate probabilities of an individual cell to transition into one of four stages--quiescence, proliferation, migration and apoptosis. We demonstrate that several features, such as continuous sprouts, cell clustering and branching, that are observed in microfluidic experiments conducted under controlled conditions using few angiogenic factors can be reproduced by this model. We also identify the transition probabilities that result in specific sprout characteristics such as long continuous sprouts and specific branching patterns. Thus, this model can be used to cluster sprout morphology as a function of various influencing factors.},

Based on online measurement of cell growth and a stochastic cell population model, a closed-loop control system is developed for regulating the process of cell migration and vascular system development. Angiogenesis is considered in a microfluidic environment, where chemical and mechanical stimuli can be applied to the cell population. A systems-level description of the angiogenesis process is formulated, and a control scheme that chooses an optimal sequence of control inputs to drive collective cell patterns toward a desired goal is presented in this paper. In response to control inputs, the k-step ahead prediction of morphologic pattern measures is evaluated, and the input that minimizes expected squared error between the future measure and its desired value is selected for the current control. Initial simulation experiments demonstrate that vascular development can be guided toward a desired morphologic pattern using this technique.},

abstract = {For all animals, cell migration is an essential and highly regulated process. Cells migrate to shape tissues, to vascularize tissues, in wound healing, and as part of the immune response. Unfortunately, tumor cells can also become migratory and invade surrounding tissues. Some cells migrate as individuals, but many cell types will, under physiological conditions, migrate collectively in tightly or loosely associated groups. This includes invasive tumor cells. This review discusses different types of collective cell migration, including sheet movement, sprouting and branching, streams, and free groups, and highlights recent findings that provide insight into cells' organization and behavior. Cells performing collective migration share many cell biological characteristics with independently migrating cells but, by affecting one another mechanically and via signaling, these cell groups are subject to additional regulation and constraints. New properties that emerge from this connectivity can contribute to shaping, guiding, and ultimately ensuring tissue function.},

abstract = {Although computational models for cell migration on two-dimensional (2D) substrata have described how various molecular and cellular properties and physiochemical processes are integrated to accomplish cell locomotion, the same issues, along with certain new ones, might contribute differently to a model for migration within three-dimensional (3D) matrices. To address this more complicated situation, we have developed a computational model for cell migration in 3D matrices using a force-based dynamics approach. This model determines an overall locomotion velocity vector, comprising speed and direction, for individual cells based on internally generated forces transmitted into external traction forces and considering a timescale during which multiple attachment and detachment events are integrated. Key parameters characterize cell and matrix properties, including cell/matrix adhesion and mechanical and steric properties of the matrix; critical underlying molecular properties are incorporated explicitly or implicitly. Model predictions agree well with experimental results for the limiting case of migration on 2D substrata as well as with recent experiments in 3D natural tissues and synthetic gels. Certain predicted features such as biphasic behavior of speed with density of matrix ligands for 3D migration are qualitatively similar to their 2D counterparts, but new effects generally absent in 2D systems, such as effects due to matrix sterics and mechanics, are now predicted to arise in many 3D situations. As one particular sample manifestation of these effects, the optimal levels of cell receptor expression and matrix ligand density yielding maximal migration are dependent on matrix mechanical compliance.},

abstract = {The influence of matrix-derived adhesive peptide sequences on encapsulated beta-cell survival and glucose-stimulated insulin release was explored by covalently incorporating synthetic peptide sequences within a model encapsulation environment. Photopolymerized poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels were functionalized via the addition of acrylate-PEG-peptide conjugates to the polymer precursor solution prior to beta-cell photoencapsulation. Individual MIN6 beta-cells were encapsulated in the presence of the laminin-derived recognition sequences, IKLLI, IKVAV, LRE, PDSGR, RGD, and YIGSR, and the collagen type I sequence, DGEA. In the absence of cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts, encapsulated MIN6 beta-cell survival diminishes within one week; however, in PEG hydrogel derivatives including the laminin sequences IKLLI and IKVAV, encapsulated beta-cells exhibit preserved viability, reduced apoptosis, and increased insulin secretion. Interactions with the laminin sequences LRE, PDSGR, RGD, and YIGSR contribute to improved viability, but insulin release from these samples was not statistically greater than that from controls. MIN6 beta-cells were also encapsulated with various concentrations of IKLLI and IKVAV (0.05-5.0mm), individually, and the peptide combinations IKLLI-IKVAV, IKVAV-YIGSR, and PDSGR-YIGSR to explore synergistic effects. The presented results give evidence that synthetic peptide epitopes may be useful in the design of an islet encapsulation environment that promotes cell survival and function via targeted cell-matrix interactions.},

In this context, decellularized matrices, obtained after the removal of tissue cellular part, are known to support in vitro adhesion, growth, and function of several cell types. We demonstrate that a homologous acellular pancreatic matrix is a suitable scaffold for rat islet cultures maintaining their long-term viability and function. Islets adhered to the pancreatic matrix showed a constant glucose-induced insulin release during long-term in vitro incubation, while islets cultured without a matrix or on the liver matrix showed a progressive reduction. In order to obtain implantable devices, acellular matrix/islet cultures were entrapped into poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/ poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) tubes obtained by the freezing/thawing procedure. Under this condition, an in vitro constant insulin release was detected. The devices were then implanted into diabetic rats where reduced insulin requirement was noted suggesting insulin secretory activity of islets contained in the device. Indeed, immunofluorescence confirmed the presence of insulin- and glucagon-producing cells into the explanted devices. These data show that PVA/PEG semi-permeable membrane can obtain devices that restore, at least in part, insulin secretion.},

abstract = {Contractile forces generated by the actomyosin cytoskeleton within individual cells collectively generate tissue-level force during epithelial morphogenesis. During Drosophila mesoderm invagination, pulsed actomyosin meshwork contractions and a ratchet-like stabilization of cell shape drive apical constriction. Here, we investigate how contractile forces are integrated across the tissue. Reducing adherens junction (AJ) levels or ablating actomyosin meshworks causes tissue-wide epithelial tears, which release tension that is predominantly oriented along the anterior-posterior (a-p) embryonic axis. Epithelial tears allow cells normally elongated along the a-p axis to constrict isotropically, which suggests that apical constriction generates anisotropic epithelial tension that feeds back to control cell shape. Epithelial tension requires the transcription factor Twist, which stabilizes apical myosin II, promoting the formation of a supracellular actomyosin meshwork in which radial actomyosin fibers are joined end-to-end at spot AJs. Thus, pulsed actomyosin contractions require a supracellular, tensile meshwork to transmit cellular forces to the tissue level during morphogenesis.},

It is a complex process orchestrated by chemistry, biological factors, microstructure and surrounding mechanical properties. Focusing on the mechanical interactions, cells do not only exert forces on the matrix that surrounds them, but they also sense and react to mechanical cues in a process called mechano-sensing. Here, we hypothesize the involvement of mechano-sensing in the regulation of directional cell migration through a three-dimensional (3D) matrix. For this purpose, we develop a 3D numerical model of individual cell migration, which incorporates the mechano-sensing process of the cell as the main mechanism regulating its movement. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that factors, such as substrate stiffness, boundary conditions and external forces, regulate specific and distinct cell movements.},

On the other hand, "in silico" tests aim to model this movement through the use of complex numerically implemented mathematical methods. This paper presents a simple cell-based mathematical model to represent the collective movement phenomena. This approach is used to better understand the different interactive forces which guide cell movement, focusing mainly on the role of the cell propulsion force with the substrate. Different applications are simulated for 2D cell cultures, wound healing, and collective cell movement in substrates with different degrees of stiffness. The model provides a plausible explanation of how cells work together in order to regulate their movement, showing the significant influence of the propulsive force exerted by the cell to the substrate on guiding the collective cell movement and its interplay with other cell forces.},

Much work has been made over the last 30years, and the time now seems ripe to provide a comprehensive review. The one here proposed is focused on the most important clinical/experimental tests performed to understand the mechanism of glucose homeostasis. The review proceeds from models of pancreatic insulin production, with a coarser/finer level of detail ranging over cellular and subcellular scales, to short-term organ/tissue models accounting for the intra-venous and the oral glucose tolerance tests as well as for the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, to total-body, long-term diabetes models aiming to represent disease progression in terms of $\beta$-cell population dynamics over a long period of years.},

abstract = {The classic paradigm for in vitro tissue engineering of bone involves the isolation and culture of donor osteoblasts or osteoprogenitor cells within three-dimensional (3D) scaffold biomaterials under conditions that support tissue growth and mineralized osteoid formation. Our studies focus on the development and utilization of new dynamic culture technologies to provide adequate nutrient flux within 3D scaffolds to support ongoing tissue formation. In this study, we have developed a basic one-dimensional (1D) model to characterize the efficiency of passive nutrient diffusion and transport flux to bone cells within 3D scaffolds under static and dynamic culture conditions. Internal fluid perfusion within modeled scaffolds increased rapidly with increasing pore volume and pore diameter to a maximum of approximately 1\% of external fluid flow. In contrast, internal perfusion decreased significantly with increasing pore channel tortuosity. Calculations of associated nutrient flux indicate that static 3D culture and some inappropriately designed dynamic culture environments lead to regions of insufficient nutrient concentration to maintain cell viability, and can result in steep nutrient concentration gradients within the modeled constructs. These quantitative studies provide a basis for development of new dynamic culture methodologies to overcome the limitations of passive nutrient diffusion in 3D cell-scaffold composite systems proposed for in vitro tissue engineering of bone.},

The microcapsules were composed of calcium alginate gels with spherical liquid cores (diameter approximately 150 microm) for formation of spheroids. The spherical liquid cores were prepared by incubating calcium alginate microcapsules containing thermally gelled, cell-enclosing gelatin microparticles about 150 microm in diameter, at 37 degrees C. The gelatin microparticles were encapsulated within the microcapsules by dropping a sodium alginate solution containing suspended gelatin microparticles into 100 mM CaCl(2). The enclosed feline renal fibroblast cell line, CRFK, cells showed 93.8\% viability immediately after encapsulation, then grew and completely filled the spherical cores. Multicellular spheroids were collected within 1 min by soaking microcapsules in a medium containing alginate lyase.},

abstract = {Hepatocyte aggregation into spheroids attributes to their increased activity, but in the absence of a vascular network the cells in large spheroids experience mass transfer limitations. Thus, there is a need to define the spheroid size which enables maximal cell viability and productivity. We developed a combined theoretical and experimental approach to define this optimal spheroid size. Hepatocyte spheroids were formed in alginate scaffolds having a pore diameter of 100 microm, in rotating T-flasks or spinners, to yield a maximal size of 100, 200, and 600 microm, respectively. Cell viability was found to decrease with increasing spheroid size. A mathematical model was constructed to describe the relationship between spheroid size and cell viability via the oxygen mass balance equation. This enabled the prediction of oxygen distribution profiles and distribution of viable cells in spheroids with varying size. The model describes that no oxygen limitation will take place in spheroids up to 100 microm in diameter. Spheroid size affected the specific rate of albumin secretion as well; it reached a maximal level, i.e., 60 microg/million cells/day in 100-microm diameter spheroids. This behavior was depicted in an equation relating the specific albumin secretion rate to spheroid size. The calculated results fitted with the experimental data, predicting the need for a critical number of viable hepatocytes to gain a maximal albumin secretion. Taken together, the results on mass transport in spheroids and its effects on cell viability and productivity provide a useful tool for the design of 3D scaffolds with pore diameters of 100 microm.},

abstract = {Fibroblast clusters have been observed in tissues under a variety of circumstances: in fibrosis and scar, in the formation of hair follicle dermal papilla, and as part of the general process of mesenchymal condensation that takes place during development. Cell clustering has been shown to depend on features of the extracellular matrix, growth factor environment, and mechanisms to stabilize cell-cell interactions. In vitro studies have shown that increasing the potential for cell-cell adhesion relative to cell-substrate adhesion promotes cell clustering. Experimental models to study fibroblast clustering have utilized centrifugation, hanging drops, and substrata with poorly adhesive, soft and mechanically unstable properties. In this review, we summarize work on a new, highly tractable, cell clustering research model in which human fibroblasts are incubated on the surfaces of collagen matrices. Fibroblast clustering occurs under procontractile growth factor conditions (e.g., serum or the serum lipid agonist lysophosphatidic acid) but not under promigratory growth factor conditions (e.g., platelet-derived growth factor) and can be reversed by switching growth factor environments. Cell contraction plays a dual role in clustering to bring cells closer together and to stimulate cells to organize fibronectin into a fibrillar matrix. Binding of fibroblasts to a shared fibronectin fibrillar matrix stabilizes clusters, and fragmentation of the fibrillar matrix occurs when growth factor conditions are switched to promote cell dispersal.},

abstract = {Collective cell migration in tissues occurs throughout embryonic development, during wound healing, and in cancerous tumor invasion, yet most detailed knowledge of cell migration comes from single-cell studies. As single cells migrate, the shape of the cell body fluctuates dramatically through cyclic processes of extension, adhesion, and retraction, accompanied by erratic changes in migration direction. Within confluent cell layers, such subcellular motions must be coupled between neighbors, yet the influence of these subcellular motions on collective migration is not known. Here we study motion within a confluent epithelial cell sheet, simultaneously measuring collective migration and subcellular motions, covering a broad range of length scales, time scales, and cell densities. At large length scales and time scales collective migration slows as cell density rises, yet the fastest cells move in large, multicell groups whose scale grows with increasing cell density. This behavior has an intriguing analogy to dynamic heterogeneities found in particulate systems as they become more crowded and approach a glass transition. In addition we find a diminishing self-diffusivity of short-wavelength motions within the cell layer, and growing peaks in the vibrational density of states associated with cooperative cell-shape fluctuations. Both of these observations are also intriguingly reminiscent of a glass transition. Thus, these results provide a broad and suggestive analogy between cell motion within a confluent layer and the dynamics of supercooled colloidal and molecular fluids approaching a glass transition.},

Traction fluctuations are anomalous, moreover, exhibiting broad non- Gaussian distributions characterized by exponential tails10–12.

abstract = {Pancreatic beta-cells are clustered in islets of Langerhans, which are typically a few hundred micrometers in a variety of mammals. In this study, we propose a theoretical model for the growth of pancreatic islets and derive the islet size distribution, based on two recent observations: First, the neogenesis of new islets becomes negligible after some developmental stage. Second, islets grow via a random process, where any cell in an islet proliferates with the same rate regardless of the present size of the islet. Our model predicts either log-normal or Weibull distributions of the islet sizes, depending on whether cells in an islet proliferate coherently or independently. To confirm this, we also measure the islet size by selectively staining islets, which are exposed from exocrine tissues in mice after enzymatic treatment. Indeed revealed are skewed distributions with the peak size of approximately 100 cells, which fit well to the theoretically derived ones. Interestingly, most islets turned out to be bigger than the expected minimal size (approximately 10 or so cells) necessary for stable synchronization of beta-cells through electrical gap-junction coupling. The collaborative behavior among cells is known to facilitate synchronized insulin secretion and tends to saturate beyond the critical (saturation) size of approximately 100 cells. We further probe how the islets change as normal mice grow from young (6 weeks) to adult (5 months) stages. It is found that islets may not grow too large to maintain appropriate ratios between cells of different types. Our results implicate that growing of mouse islets may be regulated by several physical constraints such as the minimal size required for stable cell-to-cell coupling and the upper limit to keep the ratios between cell types. Within the lower and upper limits the observed size distributions of islets can be faithfully regenerated by assuming random and uncoordinated proliferation of each beta-cell at appropriate rates.},

Nutrients, hormones and growth factors coupled with their signalling intermediates have been suggested to play a role in beta cell mass regulation. In addition, genetic mouse model studies have indicated that cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases that determine cell cycle progression are involved in beta cell replication, and more recently, menin in association with cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors has been demonstrated to be important in beta cell growth. In this review, we consider and highlight some aspects of cell cycle regulation in relation to beta cell replication. The role of cell cycle regulation in beta cell replication is mostly from studies in rodent models, but whether these findings can be extended to human beta cells remains to be shown.},

abstract = {Tissue engineering aims to regenerate, repair or replace organs or tissues which have become defective due to trauma, disease or age related degeneration. This engineering may take place within the patient's body or tissue can be regenerated in a bioreactor for later implantation into the patient. Regeneration of soft tissue is one of the most demanding applications of tissue engineering. Producing proper nutrient supply, uniform cell distribution and high cell density are the important challenges. Many experimental models exist for tissue growth in a bioreactor. It is important to put experiments into a theoretical framework. Mathematical modelling in terms of physical and biochemical mechanisms is the best tool to understand experimental results. In this work a mathematical model of convective and diffusive transport of nutrients and cell evolution in a perfusion bioreactor is developed. A cell-seeded porous scaffold is placed in a perfusion bioreactor and fluid delivers the nutrients to the cells for their growth. The model describes the key features of the tissue engineering processes which includes the interaction between the cell growth, variation of material permeability due to cell proliferation, flow of fluid through the material and delivery of nutrients to the cells. The fluid flow through the porous scaffold is modelled by Darcy's law, and the delivery of nutrients to the cells is modelled by the advection-diffusion equation. A non-linear reaction diffusion system is used to model the cell growth. The growth of cells is modelled by logistic growth. COMSOL (a commercial finite element solver) is used to numerically solve the model. The results show that the distribution of cells and total cell number in the scaffold does not depend on the initial cell density but depend on the material permeability.},

abstract = {A mathematical model for the immune system response to bacterial infections is proposed. The formalism is based on modeling the chemokine-determined transmigration of leukocytes from a venule through the venule walls and the subsequent in-tissue migration and engulfment of the pathogens that are responsible for the infection. The model is based on basic principles, such as Poiseuille blood flow through the venule, fundamental solutions of the diffusion-reaction equation for the concentration field of pathogen-released chemokines, linear chemotaxis of the leukocytes, random walk of pathogens, and stochastic processes for the death and division of pathogens. Thereby, a computationally tractable and, as far as we know, original framework has been obtained, which is used to incorporate the interaction of a substantial number of leukocytes and thereby to unravel the significance of biological processes and parameters regarding the immune system response. The developed model provides a neat way for visualization of the biophysical mechanism of the immune system response. The simulations indicate a weak correlation between the immune system response in terms of bacterial clearing time and the leukocyte stiffness, and a significant decrease in the clearing time with increasing in-blood leukocyte density, decreasing pathogen motility, and increasing venule wall transmissivity. Finally, the increase in the pathogen death rate and decrease in pathogen motility induce a decrease in the clearing time of the infection. The adjustment of the latter two quantities mimic the administration of antibiotics.},

abstract = {During development, the formation of biological networks (such as organs and neuronal networks) is controlled by multicellular transportation phenomena based on cell migration. In multi-cellular systems, cellular locomotion is restricted by physical interactions with other cells in a crowded space, similar to passengers pushing others out of their way on a packed train. The motion of individual cells is intrinsically stochastic and may be viewed as a type of random walk. However, this walk takes place in a noisy environment because the cell interacts with its randomly moving neighbors. Despite this randomness and complexity, development is highly orchestrated and precisely regulated, following genetic (and even epigenetic) blueprints. Although individual cell migration has long been studied, the manner in which stochasticity affects multi-cellular transportation within the precisely controlled process of development remains largely unknown. To explore the general principles underlying multicellular migration, we focus on the migration of neural crest cells, which migrate collectively and form streams. We introduce a mechanical model of multi-cellular migration. Simulations based on the model show that the migration mode depends on the relative strengths of the noise from migratory and non-migratory cells. Strong noise from migratory cells and weak noise from surrounding cells causes "collective migration," whereas strong noise from non-migratory cells causes "dispersive migration." Moreover, our theoretical analyses reveal that migratory cells attract each other over long distances, even without direct mechanical contacts. This effective interaction depends on the stochasticity of the migratory and non-migratory cells. On the basis of these findings, we propose that stochastic behavior at the single-cell level works effectively and precisely to achieve collective migration in multi-cellular systems.},

abstract = {In this study, a cell based lattice free modelling framework is proposed to study cell aggregate behaviour in bone tissue engineering applications. The model encompasses cell-to-cell and cell-environment interactions such as adhesion, repulsion and drag forces. Oxygen, nutrients, waste products, growth factors and inhibitors are explicitly represented in the model influencing cellular behaviour. Furthermore, a model for cell metabolism is incorporated representing the basic enzymic reactions of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. Various types of cell death such as necrosis, apoptosis and anoikis are implemented. Finally, an explicit model of the cell cycle controls the proliferation process, taking into account the presence or absence of various metabolites, sufficient space and mechanical stress. Several examples are presented demonstrating the potential of the modelling framework. The behaviour of a synchronised cell aggregate under ideal circumstances is simulated, clearly showing the different stages of the cell cycle and the resulting growth of the aggregate. Also the difference in aggregate development under ideal (normoxic) and hypoxic conditions is simulated, showing hypoxia induced necrosis mainly in the centre of the aggregate grown under hypoxic conditions. The next step in this research will be the application of this modelling framework to specific experimental set-ups for bone tissue engineering applications.},

In vivo and in vitro models enabled identification of different factors in the tumor microenvironment that regulate tumor progression and metastasis. However, the mechanisms by which tumor cells integrate these chemical and mechanical signals from multiple sources to navigate the complex microenvironment remain poorly understood. In this review, we discuss the factors that influence tumor cell migration with a focus on the migration of transformed carcinoma cells. We provide an overview of the experimental and computational methods that allow the investigation of tumor cell migration, and we highlight the benefits and shortcomings of the various assays. We emphasize that the chemical and mechanical stimulus paradigms are not independent and that crosstalk between them motivates the development of new assays capable of applying multiple, simultaneous stimuli and imaging the cellular migratory response in real-time. These next-generation assays will more closely mimic the in vivo microenvironment to provide new insights into tumor progression, inform techniques to control tumor cell migration, and render cancer more treatable.},

abstract = {In vivo monitoring of stem cells after grafting is essential for a better understanding of their migrational dynamics and differentiation processes and of their regeneration potential. Migration of endogenous or grafted stem cells and neurons has been described in vertebrate brain, both under normal conditions from the subventricular zone along the rostral migratory stream and under pathophysiological conditions, such as degeneration or focal cerebral ischemia. Those studies, however, relied on invasive analysis of brain sections in combination with appropriate staining techniques. Here, we demonstrate the observation of cell migration under in vivo conditions, allowing the monitoring of the cell dynamics within individual animals, and for a prolonged time. Embryonic stem (ES) cells, constitutively expressing the GFP, were labeled by a lipofection procedure with a MRI contrast agent and implanted into rat brains. Focal cerebral ischemia had been induced 2 weeks before implantation of ES cells into the healthy, contralateral hemisphere. MRI at 78-microm isotropic spatial resolution permitted the observation of the implanted cells with high contrast against the host tissue, and was confirmed by GFP registration. During 3 weeks, cells migrated along the corpus callosum to the ventricular walls, and massively populated the borderzone of the damaged brain tissue on the hemisphere opposite to the implantation sites. Our results indicate that ES cells have high migrational dynamics, targeted to the cerebral lesion area. The imaging approach is ideally suited for the noninvasive observation of cell migration, engraftment, and morphological differentiation at high spatial and temporal resolution.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Modeling the cell-division cycle has been practiced for many years. As time has progressed, this work has gone from understanding the basic principles to addressing distinct biological problems, e.g., the nature of the restriction point, how checkpoints operate, the nonlinear dynamics of the cell cycle, the effect of localization, etc. Most models consist of coupled ordinary differential equations developed by the researchers, restricted to deal with the interactions of a limited number of molecules. In the future, cell-cycle modeling--and indeed all modeling of complex biologic processes--will increase in scope and detail.RESULTS:A framework for modeling complex cell-biologic processes is proposed here. The framework is based on two constructs: one describing the entire lifecycle of a molecule and the second describing the basic cellular machinery. Use of these constructs allows complex models to be built in a straightforward manner that fosters rigor and completeness. To demonstrate the framework, an example model of the mammalian cell cycle is presented that consists of several hundred differential equations of simple mass action kinetics. The model calculates energy usage, amino acid and nucleotide usage, membrane transport, RNA synthesis and destruction, and protein synthesis and destruction for 33 proteins to give an in-depth look at the cell cycle.CONCLUSIONS:The framework presented here addresses how to develop increasingly descriptive models of complex cell-biologic processes. The example model of cellular growth and division constructed with the framework demonstrates that large structured models can be created with the framework, and these models can generate non-trivial descriptions of cellular processes. Predictions from the example model include those at both the molecular level--e.g., Wee1 spontaneously reactivates--and at the system level--e.g., pathways for timing-critical processes must shut down redundant pathways. A future effort is to automatically estimate parameter values that are insensitive to changes.},

abstract = {Collective cell migration plays an important role during wound healing and embryo development. Although the exact mechanisms that coordinate such migration are still unknown, experimental studies of moving cell layers have shown that the primary interactions governing the motion of the layer are the force of lamellipodia, the adhesion of cells to the substrate, and the adhesion of cells to each other. Here, we derive a two-dimensional continuum mechanical model of cell-layer migration that is based on a novel assumption of elastic deformation of the layer and incorporates basic mechanical interactions of cells as well as cell proliferation and apoptosis. The evolution equations are solved numerically using a level set method. The model successfully reproduces data from two types of experiments: 1), the contraction of an enterocyte cell layer during wound healing; and 2), the expansion of a radially symmetric colony of MDCK cells, both in the edge migration velocity and in cell-layer density. In accord with experimental observations, and in contrast to reaction-diffusion models, this model predicts a partial wound closure if lamellipod formation is inhibited at the wound edge and gives implications of the effect of spatially restricted proliferation.},
