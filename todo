* base [1/2]
- [ ] Newton Method class
- [X] Nitsche Method [2/2]
  - [X] Co-normal derivatives (plus dual)
  - [X] Penalty terms

** base/mesh [1/2]
- [X] Structured Grid
- [ ] Lattice     

** base/sfun [1/3]
- [X] B-Splines <degree, alpha>  with regularity 
- [ ] Inf-sup stable elements: bubbles (?)
- [ ] Spline variants

** base/dof [2/2]
- [X] IndexMap::generateFromGrid
- [X] 'structured-ness' dependent call in dof::generate

** base/time [0/2]
- [ ] Mass lumping and Adams-Bashforth methods
- [ ] HHT Time stepper + DOF with velocity and acceleration

* solid [0/0]

* fluid [0/1]
- [ ] Stokes stabilisation

* mat [0/1]
- [ ] Test Ogden material

* tutorials [0/3]
- [ ] rename to references
- [ ] tutorial docu
- [ ] test app for incompressible material
- [ ] test apps with compilability and reference results

* beauty
- [ ] replace all ASCII graphics by proper png files
- [ ] base/io/tikz/Writer which generates a tex file with a tikzpicture of the mesh

* other [1/3]
- [ ] Level Set Tool
- [X] Linear poro elasticity
- [ ] Poro elasticity with coupled advection diffusion equation


* cleanup [0/2]
- [ ] remove .cols(), .rows(), .col(), .row(), .tail() and .head() 
      functions from code
      and put equivalent functions into base::linearAlgebra
      --> seperate the code more from Eigen functionality
- [ ] replace ITER::value_type by iterator_traits<ITER>::value_type
      --> allow for e.g. boost::array<value_type>::iterator which is a pure pointer
